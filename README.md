# Arc - a minimal Angular API representation

It's nothing for no one. Seriously, It's a small play with Angular here.

## Try on

Install all the dependencies in all the locations.

```sh
$ yarn && (cd example && yarn) && (cd example/dist && yarn)
```

Run Webpack Dev Server and wait until it will tell you that everithing is ok (default: 0.0.0.0:8080)

```sh
$ yarn --cwd example run webpack-dev-server --host=0.0.0.0 --static=dist/ --mode=development
```

Go to the http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser.

## That's it
